The initial collection of example runs was collected by Magnus Hagdorn.

The EISMINT tests are described in the following two papers:
Huybrechts, Ph., A.J. Payne and EISMINT Intercomparison Group (1996). The EISMINT benchmarks for testing ice-sheet models.  Annals of Glaciology 23, 1-12.
Payne, A.J. , Ph. Huybrechts, A. Abe-Ouchi, R. Calov, J.L. Fastook, R. Greve, S.J. Marshall, I. Marsiat, C. Ritz, L. Tarasov, and M.P.A. Thomassen (2000). Results from the EISMINT model intercomparison: the effects of thermomechanical coupling. Journal of Glaciology, 46(153), 227-238.
