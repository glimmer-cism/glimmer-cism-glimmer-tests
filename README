This is a collection of examples demonstrating and testing various aspects
of GLIMMER.

The EISMINT-1 and EISMINT-2 directories contain model configuration files for 
most EISMINT test cases. The eis directory contains an example configuration
for the Edinburgh Ice Sheet model climate driver. It is based on the climate
driver described in the PhD thesis of Magnus Hagdorn. The lin-non_lin and
isos directories contain some experiments testin the linear and non-linear
solvers and the isostasy code. Finally, the PyCF directory contains some
examples showing how the visualisation scripts might be used.

These examples and tests should be viewed as a demonstration of what GLIMMER
can do. It's not a test suite as such. We are working on that.

./configure
make
